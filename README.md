# Kodeloftet_Dag5

focused on techniques for creating effective eye-catchers, i.e. how we can highlight important elements to direct the users' attention.

This can involve everything from using the right color palette and contrasts to the placement of elements and the use of images. 

The purpose of the eye-catchers is not only to capture interest, but also to create a more intuitive and efficient navigation flow on the website.

How we structure our HTML elements plays an important role in how we can later use CSS to create the visual structure we want. Especially when we use the flexbox placement method, the HTML tree - i.e. the hierarchy between the HTML elements - becomes decisive for the final result on the website.

Flexbox allows us to place content in columns and rows in a flexible way, which gives good control over how the content is distributed and adapted to different screen sizes.

Being able to put content in depth, columns and rows also allows us to convey information in a structured way, which in turn positively affects the user experience.

By mastering these techniques, we can create a design that not only looks good but also works optimally for the intended target group.

**Task**

Use a webite you've started on, or set up a new one, to explore the design principles we've gone through. 

Try out different layout structures by creating varied content that has different placement and style, depending on what you want the layout to communicate. 

This will give you experience with how different design choices affect the user experience, and give you insight into what works best for your website's target audience.

**Claim**:

Create sections that show the different design layouts with different content that is appropriate.

Create a card such as a card that contains a headline, text, image and links.

**Bonus**:

Experiment with the background properties in CSS to create element backgrounds

Experiment with creating placeholder information in the various layouts you create here in the Portfolio project, which can later be filled in correctly when we  progressed further.
